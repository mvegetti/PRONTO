<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
PRONTO (PRoduct ONTOlogy) is an ontology for the Product Modeling domain, able to efficiently handle product variants. It defines and integrates two hierarchies to represent product information: the Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) and the Structural one (SH). This contribution presents a ConceptBase formal specification of PRONTO that focuses on the structural hierarchy of products. This hierarchy is a tool to handle product information associated with the multiple available recipes or processes to manufacture a particular product or a set of similar products. The formal specification presented in the paper also includes mechanisms to infer structural information from the explicit knowledge represented at each of the AH levels: Family, VariantSet and Product. This proposal efficiently handles a great number of variants and allows representing product information with distinct granularity degrees, which is a requirement for planning activities taking place at different time horizons. PRONTO easily manages crucial features that should be taken into account in a product representation, such as the efficient handling of product families and variants concepts, composition and decomposition structures and the possibility of specifying constraints. </span>
